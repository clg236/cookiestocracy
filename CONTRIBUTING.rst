Contributing to Democrasite
===========================

Obviously this project doesn't work without people adding contributions, preferable many people adding lots of little contributions frequently. The project is oriented towards contributions which add new apps or features, with the constitution mechanic aimed at making it harder to significantly alter existing code than to add new things. The constitution is also aimed at protecting the core purpose and philosophy of the site, *not* its functionality. There are innumerable ways to just break the deployment or delivery of the website and I humbly ask that you refrain from intentionally doing so. If I see a pull request which breaks the site, I will close it. Use this website as a playground for whatever project you have that you want to see hosted as long as Django can serve it; I'd love for this to serve people's random creations. That being said, there are plenty of contributions and additions you could make to the site itself, such as to this document, which tells people nothing about how to contribute at the moment. Regardless of how you choose contribute, as long as it is in good faith, I appreciate it.
